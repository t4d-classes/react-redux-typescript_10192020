# Exercise 9
1. When the user clicks a column header, sort the table on that column. The first click, will sort ascending. The second click, will sort descending.

JavaScript does have sort function for array. You will need to use it, but be sure to understand how it performs the sort.

2. When performing an ascending sort, display the text "(asc)" next to the column name. When performing a descending sort, display the text (desc) next to the column name.

3. Ensure it works!
