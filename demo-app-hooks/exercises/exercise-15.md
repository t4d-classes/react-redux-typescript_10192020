# Exercise 15

1. Display a list of operations beneath the buttons. The list of operations is history of the operations (button clicks) performed by the user. For each list item, display the operation performed and the value typed into in the input. DO NOT INCLUDE the result in the history.

2. If a user types a 0 into the input and clicks divide, do not perform the mathematical operation, instead display a validation message. I do not care about styling.

3. Ensure it works.
