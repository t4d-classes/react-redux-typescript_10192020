# Exercise 11

1. Fully implement save car and cancel car buttons. Be sure to perform your save operation with immutable programming techniques. When the cancel button is clicked, revert the changes back to the original.

Hint: To do the save, you can copy the array, next replace the item in the copy, then save the new array. A function such as findIndex can be used to find the index of an item.

2. If one of the table rows is being edited, the edit row should change to a view row after, a car is added, or a car is deleted, or a car is saved. Add or delete, the changes for the one being edited should not be saved.

3. Ensure it works!
