# Exercise 2

## Steps

1. Below the header in Car Tool, add a table of cars (please use an HTML table and the related table elements). The table of cars should be in the Car Tool component. The table should have a header row with the following column headers:

Id, Make, Model, Year, Color, Price

2. Hard code two rows of car data. Not 1 row, not 3 or more rows - just 2 rows. And hard code the rows, do not dynamically generate them.

3. Reload the page, and ensure the table is displayed beneath the header of Car Tool.

4. Ensure it works!
